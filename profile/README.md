 Using Spree for the past decade, we've been dedicated to creating and maintaining extensions. Our mission is to keep extensions up to date with Spree and to build new ones that enhance the platform.

## Who we are?
We are a team of open-source contributors actively developing and maintaining extensions for Spree. As part of [Bluebash.co](bluebash.co) & [Nextbrand.online](www.nextbrand.online), we specialize in building custom Spree applications with over a decade of expertise, including customizations like multi-vendor setups, marketplaces, and more. Currently, we maintain 12+ production Spree applications at [bluebash.co](www.bluebash.co).

## What do we have?
We manage a wide range of forked Spree extensions, all maintained to align with the latest Spree versions, along with our own custom Spree extensions. We are committed to continuously supporting and advancing this work. Our efforts are non-profit, and we operate independently from the official Spree contributors and maintainers.

## Private extensions libraray on request

If you're looking for specific extensions that aren't available as open-source, feel free to reach out to us for more information.
